Wait - don't do it! Don't write about team work on a public forum, where you're team mates might read it! Are you nuts!?

Team work is boring

Yes. It is. Sometimes. Anything can be boring - sometimes. Someone said to me once: "Only boring people get bored". Then again, he was THE guy that brought an acoustic guitar to a party and couldn't really play it.. Or sing.. I guess not being tonedeaf is boring - too.

Be a genious, if you have to. Otherwise - work as a team. The hive mind effect is just something that is undismissable in our current culture. There's so much free information flying around in midst of the pressurized feelings that a stress induced stream of collective conciousness might have - trying to work together solving a puzzle, that is important for agruing capital and maybe intriguing to overcome proving one's mental faculties - once again! But is it important, really? Is it
boring?

Try hitting your team mates with a small hammer. Repetitively. Aim for the exact same spot every time. It helps: It's not boring! It induces strong memories and is a learning experience - for sure!

How about a mind game: you're in a car accident. Your left leg is pinned between the door and the steering wheel as the chassis has bent out of shape. There's a small hammer sticking out of your forehead, but you're still alive. The car might catch into flames any minute. Your team mate is sitting beside you - unconscious. Now the question is, do you feel lucky? Well, do ya? Punk!?

In a haptic.. no.. hectic.. well haptic in the sense that everyone is walking around as if bodysnatchers (90's movie) of some retarded alien swan breed has taken over the world as they shuffle through daily commutes with their necks bent down, glaring at their phones - haptic. In a hectic world though, we need to keep these things in mind. What things? There's no time to go back. You need to figure it out before the commute is over. Finish that tweet, quick.

Team work is fun

The fuck.. isn't this bullshit over yet? I was pretty sure I killed this storyline pretty thoroughly. Any potential plot it might've had is for sure shredded to pieces by now. The flow has been interrupted with a huge dam of dumb by the forces of unrelated randomness. This - is a literal equivalent of a fart: it stops the author to wiff the air as to say: "interesting" for no apparent reason, but appals all others. So who's boring?

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
