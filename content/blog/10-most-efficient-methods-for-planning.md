How to Plan Your Schedule
-------------------------

1. Figure out what you're supposed to do
1. Do the stuff you planned
1. If that fails, plan better and try again

After going through several ways to plan projects and follow those plans I'm currently taking a break from trying any more methodologies. I slowly came to the conclusion, that the planning is too often regarded as an end goal. This conclusion is quite self evident, but I feel it is dismissed often for lack of validation or other random reasons.

As if it was a legend, a presumed myth exists of a golden nugget of perspective that steers whomever finds it to the other end of the rainbow. This might be my hindsight bias doing the talking, but I think that that cathartic feeling of finding the right way is acting as the foundation for sharing the "my way" throughout the blogosphere. Many felt it was some specific minor detail they discovered, that thwarted the dismaying obstructions out of their path emancipating those troubled souls from their purgatory of procrastination and confusion and they lived to tell the tale. I wonder though, if planning routine hides any solutions within, but rather softens the psychological aspects of working through the problem. I hypothesize that it's probably the work put into reaching a goal, that ultimatately resolves the issues along the path and planning just irons out the expectations that spawn in between one's current state and their goal.
