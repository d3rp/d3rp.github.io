Scrapbook of software related memorabilia.

The name is ironic and came about, when I read one too many a title starting with "X days to Y". I thought - how about "5 minutes to learn Haskell"? 

The name is an anagram of my real name - just never got used to the facebook provoked, MTV-cribs-like oversharing of privacy. I still feel as sharing your real name and address on the web is kinda stupid. But yeah - facebook started long ago and MTV-cribs was even further back in history.
