    <section class="post-content">
        <p>I went on stackoverflow to look for an answer to how to fix &ldquo;X&rdquo; in my dockerized
instance running a build framework - a CI system if you will. What I found was
not an answer, but instead a link to another site with which I was implied to
stop searching for answers on stackoverflow. It felt surprisingly like a splash
of cold water against my face - don&rsquo;t ask me why, I fathom not how to verbalize
it. The page I landed on told me to look from a newly founded subdomain:
devops.stackexchange.com&hellip;</p>
<p>So apparently - now, after grudgingly setting up our build system, thinking it
would help us all to build what we&rsquo;re developing faster and better - I felt
guided away from the &ldquo;developer crowd&rdquo; as if there was some allegorical bouncer
shoving a palm in my face and showing me to get out of the line while closing the
chain that separates whatever I am from the party that the &ldquo;real developers&rdquo;
were overflowing to with privileged nonchalance. I felt I walked away with a
paper note stamped on my back that said &ldquo;devops&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Reaching over to my book shelf I picked up an imaginary, unscientific, totally
opinionated and thoroughly redundant volume that read &ldquo;what I think&rdquo; on its
cover. It said: The birth of &ldquo;the fullstack engineer&rdquo; and &ldquo;devops&rdquo; is rooted in
the growth of corporations and their attempts to weed out workforce that they
would otherwise need to employ. While feeding them koolaid of hyped terms for
support, their strategy is structured on the premise of cost reductions more
than any revolutionary development practise; Those employees left over after
co-operational discussions and the effective leaves following those, would
otherwise realise, they amount to more than 1 persons task force - maybe even
amounting to something handled previously by 2 or even more people.</p>
<p>However, they are not doing the same work as those +1 persons that previously
handled, if not the same, at least similar tasks before - they are told - but
instead the whole company is adopting a Whole New Philosophy. Of course this
habitual change mostly shows up only in the developers&rsquo; work flow, because she&rsquo;s
the one executing the actual work while adapting to the increase of work volume.
If the koolaid is appropriately sweetened, the newly wed fullstack devops ninja
is too jaded to realise that they&rsquo;re getting fucked for a good while. When they
finally wake up to the reality that they&rsquo;re held accountable to stuff they
didn&rsquo;t sign in on originally, a culture has begun in the corporation to which
newcomers are then welcomed and with them churning a charlatan effect that
accumulates momentum on every developer generation - one where the affected is
half confused and half too ashamed for too long to come forward and put their
foot down until they realize this leviathon gives mainly the options to leave or
to be churned further.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s an abundant source of fresh developers reading medium.com etc. and are
lead to believe they have to x and y in order to become worthy of the prestiged
title of a developer. These provide the meat for the grinder in the mill of this
fullstack devops ninja star culture.</p>
<p>Fuck me, I was there once. It felt ok as long as my hopes were kept up. And they
were! It&rsquo;s one of those things that the corporative hive mind tends to
prioritize in order to get a nice, juicy investment bias flowing in the befooled
developer - or should I say - devops engineer. I mean, it&rsquo;s a different
subdomain altogether after all.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s sidetrack on some existential questions briefly, so I can hint of why this
has quite demotivational repercusions. Again, bare in mind I understand these
are from my notorious and dusty book of &ldquo;opinions - there and back&rdquo; refered to
earlier. What&rsquo;s the point of working in the first place? It always surprises me to hear
someone refering to work as something that keeps them busy as if they were
unable to come up with interesting things to do on their own. I do not relate to
that - there&rsquo;s a million things I could do if there was resources for them.
However ends need to be met and so I need to create some income. Still - if I
can choose - I&rsquo;d rather keep my mind in good spirits and occupied with some
interesting tasks for those hours I have to grind at work. Devops encompasses a
myriad of secondary objectives usually catering to the core of the development
endeavours. If they&rsquo;re the sole purpose to my being in a company, I doubt I
would either learn or enjoy it as much as if instead I was doing some other
projects as well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devops is not a role, it&rsquo;s a culture - a technique of tooling management&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s what she said. But somehow I ended up being a devops engineer and
&ldquo;working with devops&rdquo;. It almost seems as if the upper management in
hierarchical corporations, although development oriented, don&rsquo;t really dig into
the meanings and details of things they fast-read out of a bookshelf recommended
by some technology management evangelist. Rather, it seems, they pretty much
just wing it, and &ldquo;do what others do&rdquo; - which of course ironically are also based on
some similar kind of hasty individuals in a rush to rationalize their position.
They might be stuck in their ways, and seemingly, but just seemingly, steer
towards more modern ways.</p>
<p>It might not be obvious from reading this, but I&rsquo;ve enjoyed my past positions.
The core of my realization written in these paragraphs nevertheless holds true.
I myself consider devops as a way to maximize the tooling at hand which most
likely requires improving on it as the velocity and volume of the team grows.
That implies spending some time creating more tooling to extend the existing
tech stack. But isn&rsquo;t that just more maintenance and special little gadgets for
the sake of amusement and to distract the developers from focusing on the core
development?</p>
<p>I think there&rsquo;s lots of easy examples to elaborate my view on this matter; For
example, tooling can be something like a compiler, monitoring system in the
cloud or a slack channel with integrations.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s consider the compiler as an example. One compiles their code and spends
time waiting for the results of the changes they made - it&rsquo;s a feedback loop.
The longer that feedback loop is, the harder things get, generally. If things
get, in relation to the tasks at hand, too complicated, either the team has to
hire more people to manage the mess or do something about it. To be frank,
usually just hiring people is not a quick solution, and the extended team would
benefit from using proper tooling, too.</p>
<p>How about trying to spend some time improving on the compilation time or the
linkage process? Maybe create something to handle parts of the compilation
like for example on other platforms if you&rsquo;re building a cross platform product. This
might entail documenting the changes - maybe it makes sense to have a guide
instead of a script in order to handle the process in a more manageable way.
This then would be communicated to the rest of the team and hopefully everyone
wins!</p>
<p>Maybe it would be a monitoring system in the cloud telling what the rate of the
data ingestion were or the state of the cloud components in the system are. Who
would design and create these? Does it mean, that the person that figures this
out, is forever chained to them and any breakages or required changes are on them
and them alone?</p>
<p>The tooling could entail integrations on a slack channel to centralize the state
of change for the code, the builds, the cloud allocations.. Everything in one
place - less context switching: great success! So is it the person&rsquo;s
responsibility that improved on this to ensure all those are running, if all
they did was enter a webhook and minimal stylization for kicks for the
integrations to happen?</p>
<p>This is what I&rsquo;m getting at - these projects don&rsquo;t require an office building
full of developers and nuclear missile keys to get running anymore. Most of the
software technologies follow similar design and development principles and
patterns. Basically any developer worth their salt, can whip up at least
something of the kind and have it running in reasonable amount of time. It then
doesn&rsquo;t make sense to allocate people just and only for these purposes - or hand
out hats implying certain roles for those that take the initiative.</p>
<p>Most likely there&rsquo;s specializations in the team - at least if they&rsquo;re diverse
enough. They can then spearhead those sideprojects and on-board others into using,
developing and maintaining them. This is devops in my opinion.</p>
<p>There is of course bigger corporations that require whole teams centred around
one specific small area of development. Also for example companies with niche
specialization being the core of their business model, which also requires
considerable amount of scaffolding, would justify &ldquo;devops engineers&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s
certainly cases in which that makes sense. That said, most of the firms aren&rsquo;t
huge. Most of the tasks developers deal with, aren&rsquo;t that huge or complex
either.  Most of the tasks we handle, are kind of minute. The collected sum of
those become a bigger concept, but they are often made of smaller pieces. And
for those pieces, you don&rsquo;t usually need a dedicated devops engineer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll now put my rant-hatchet down, swallow my pride, read on the instructions
and finish that blasted build system that certainly I&rsquo;ll be the main and
probably sole maintainer of. That&rsquo;s how it usually goes even in places where
they&rsquo;ve read about devops as a philosophy.</p>
