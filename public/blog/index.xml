      <description>Exit, Bash! I wish I would have been told at the beginning of my journey: &amp;quot;Yes, Bash has some quirky behavior and yes, you can work around them.

It is better, because if you traverse towards the depths of the root of the filesystem, ctrl-p might hang for what seems like an eternity on my old Thinkpad (am I completing the stereotype?</description>
