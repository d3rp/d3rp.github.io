                <p>There was some mysterious &lt;92&gt;, &lt;93&gt;, &lt;94&gt; and &lt;96&gt; tags in a painfully pretentious and clumsily condescending essay / diary entry / blog post I had written in the past (it wasn&rsquo;t stylistically cohesive either, as you can deduct from all the slashes). The encoding was latin[dos] as reported by vim which is probably because I used to use Windows. There was so many red flags in this equation that something had to be done - so I chose to fix those characters, as if that was the most burning issue in this ordeal. Frankly though, I should&rsquo;ve been given the file a few runs with <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/shred">shred</a> and thus sense a hint of closure with my past.</p>
<p>What does one do when they need to figure out how to work with a command line or a curses based tool? Ask stackoverflow. Or rather, google for a readily available answer. I mean, why contribute to the infosharing by asking relevant questions or checking answers in the docs oneself? *cough* So in short, I found <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/2801132">the answer on stackoverflow</a>. However I found it after landing on atomic object&rsquo;s blog post about <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2011/06/21/character-encoding-tricks-for-vim/">character encoding tricks for vim</a> that explains how to change
encodings and check for character codes. It is as if I had learned this before, but something that I learned later pushed it away.. As if that was a thing.</p>
<p>I usually validate the sed commands (that&rsquo;s what I call replacing in vim, because it basically is that) that I&rsquo;m about to use with using find.</p>
<p>Finding &lt;92&gt; characters:
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-vim" data-lang="vim"><span style="display:flex;"><span>/\%<span style="color:#a6e22e">x92</span></span></span></code></pre></div></p>
<p>Replacing those characters with &lsquo;:
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-vim" data-lang="vim"><span style="display:flex;"><span>:%<span style="color:#a6e22e">s</span><span style="color:#e6db74">/\%x92/</span>&#39;/<span style="color:#a6e22e">g</span></span></span></code></pre></div></p>
<p>Changing the encoding of the file after the changes to utf-8 (when in doubt, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">utf-8</a>):
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-vim" data-lang="vim"><span style="display:flex;"><span>:<span style="color:#a6e22e">set</span> ++<span style="color:#a6e22e">enc</span>=<span style="color:#a6e22e">UTF</span><span style="color:#ae81ff">-8</span></span></span></code></pre></div></p>
<p>ps. you can use undo after setting the encoding this way.</p>
