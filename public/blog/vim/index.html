<h2 id="vim-explore-blogi">Vim explore blogi</h2>

<p>A lone crusader in the vortex that the rabbit whole of diggin into features&hellip;
features / many among many. so many, I get dismayed.</p>

<p>Alan Kay said, that the touchscreen is the worst interface ever. Paraphrasing: an interface designed for everyone is not especially good for anyone. In the age of the web and everything interconnected through myriad backend services which can be orchestrated with a click of a mouse button - I feel, that the mouse is not that good of an interface either. Having had some experiences clicking word documents&rsquo; formatting triangles (what are those even called) and clicking through million
checkbox, while trying to hold back tears of frustration, when trying to tell some highly productized NAS server system to empty some space, I&rsquo;ve grown wary of the graphical interfaces that the Microsoft product line and basically all web ui systems try to push down our throats. I prefer a little more control even if it has a longer learning curve - as long as jumping from one system to another has some similarities in functions and usability. e.g. imagine if on every windows program
ctrl+c and ctrl+v were mapped for something else than copy paste? I&rsquo;ve run across such applications, and they&rsquo;re terrible to use. Some common conventions are nice and dumbing things down out of the reach of a keyboard (via keyboard shortcuts) is - in my opinion - wasted development time. Unless it&rsquo;s for triggering missile alerts in an idiot proof way or something streamlined like that..</p>

<p>With that said - what&rsquo;s the first experience of vim? It has it&rsquo;s sensible key sequences of which quitting the program is the first one, that a young grasshopper learns. Then, ctrl+c does not copy anything, and ctrl+v pastes nothing. It&rsquo;s &lsquo;y&rsquo; and &lsquo;p&rsquo; for &lsquo;yank&rsquo; and &lsquo;paste&rsquo;. If you get past those experiences, you might take the vimtutor and quickref routes to extensive help documentation, that reads like no other manual (info or man pages). Also, they present a truck load of information and
if you&rsquo;re not typing with an american keyboard layout, &lsquo;]&rsquo; is not the most ergonomic option to follow the links - of which there is a million.</p>

<p>Drained of hope, I turned to notepad++. I was still working on windows and didn&rsquo;t know better. Some scripts were written using it. At one point, I started learning Java and with it I used an IDE. I went through a bunch of them with a bunch of other languages: Netbeans, Eclipse, Intellij Idea, Code-Blocks, Clion, QtCreator, PyCharm&hellip; What ultimately turned me to use vim heavily was the erratic operation of these IDEs on an old laptop - which had no trouble doing most of the things those
IDEs offered with a fraction of the memory and cpu. Also, I didn&rsquo;t work on any big projects with milions of lines of code and a small nations worth of team mates - so setting up a project for every little thing I wanted to write or do seemed redundant - if I could fire off vim and get it done in an instance.</p>

<p>While dabbling with nifty word, sentence and paragraph editing options, the fresh vimster thinks of other extensive options - maybe plugins or funtions. Soon the vim experience is filled with custom fonts, highlighting themes, autocompleters that write the code for you, file browsers and whatnot.</p>

<p>Used for years withour internalizing these basics

<p>Then
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ajh17/a8f5f194079818b99199">some github</a></p>

<p>So ctrlp and nerdtree were unnecessary. Seeing a work colleague traversing through the terminal with cd this and cd that I wondered why arent we using vim and ranger. Turned theres even better option
