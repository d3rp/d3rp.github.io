      <description>Exit, Bash! I wish I would have been told at the beginning of my journey: &amp;quot;Yes, Bash has some quirky behavior and yes, you can work around them. But unless what you are doing is either trivial or insignificant, you should really look for a better tool.&amp;quot; And by trivial, as we will see, I mean not using conditionals, subshells, pipes or functions.
I&#39;m not considering Bash appropriate for writing any important application (you&#39;d have to be insane to want to do that).</description>

      <description>After finding ctrl-p I thought it solved my navigation issues with vim. Additionally, it&amp;rsquo;s convenient to split a pane in tmux from within ranger and then continue with ctrl-p. George Ornbo showed a better way though: netrw instead of nerdtree
It is better, because if you traverse towards the depths of the root of the filesystem, ctrl-p might hang for what seems like an eternity on my old Thinkpad (am I completing the stereotype?</description>
